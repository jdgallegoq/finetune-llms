This is something cats do that dogs are not physically capable of doing. It has also been proven that purring can lower your stress levels and your blood pressure. \\n2. Quieter. A cat isn't going to howl at the moon, bark at anyone who knocks at the door, or anything else. While a cat might meow on occasion, they are much quieter than dogs. \\n3. Less Care. Even though cats do have litterboxes, this is far less trouble than having to walk a dog every day and give it plenty of exercise. You also don't have to take a cat outside to use the bathroom when it is raining outside. \\n4. Less Space. Cats do not need huge amounts of space. Even if you want to set up a play area for them, this can be vertical instead of sprawled out over the floor. Also, cat toys are usually smaller than dog toys, and a cat will take up less space on your bed than most dogs will. \\n5. Less Food. Cats don't eat as much food as dogs do, so their food lasts longer and will probably be cheaper than a dog's food. \\n6. Less Destruction. A bored cat is far less likely to damage something it shouldn't. This is compared to dogs, who might chew on the furniture or any number of other things. \\n7. Cleaner. Cats rarely need baths due to the fact that they do a great job of keeping themselves clean. They certainly aren't going to be playing in the mud or tracking dirt into the house, even if you let them outside. \\nI hope this can help put an end to your argument. \", 'role': 'assistant'}], 'category': 'Brainstorm', 'base_assistant_message': 'A:<|im_start|>system\\nB:ut\\nC:ut\\nD:ut\\nE:ut\\nF:ut\\nG:ut\\nH:ut\\nI:ut\\nJ:ut\\nK:ut\\nL:ut\\nM:ut\\nN:ut\\nO:ut\\nP:ut\\nQ:ut\\nR:ut\\nS:ut\\nT:ut\\nU:ut\\nV:ut\\nW:ut\\nX:ut\\nY:ut'}\n"
